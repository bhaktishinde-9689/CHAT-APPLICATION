## In this task, I developed a Real-Time Chat Application that allows users to send and receive messages instantly. The project was built using Node.js, Express.js, Socket.IO, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and it was developed using the Visual Studio Code (VS Code) editor.

The main purpose of this application is to enable real-time communication between multiple users through a web interface. When a user types a message and sends it, the message is immediately displayed to all connected users without refreshing the page.

The backend of the application was created using Node.js and Express.js, which handle the server-side operations and manage the communication between users. Socket.IO was used to establish real-time connections between the client and the server.

The frontend was designed using HTML and CSS for the structure and styling of the chat interface, while JavaScript was used to handle sending and receiving messages.

This project helped me understand important concepts such as real-time communication, client-server interaction, and event-based programming. It also improved my knowledge of building full-stack applications and handling multiple users in a chat system.

Overall, this task helped me gain practical experience in developing a real-time web application and strengthened my understanding of both frontend and backend development.
